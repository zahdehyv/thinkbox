> **Prompt engineering** is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in order to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model.
>
> A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform. A prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query, a command, or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, choice of words and grammar, providing relevant context, or describing a character for the AI to mimic.
>
> When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as "a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse" or "Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing, and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.
