> A fetish is an object believed to have supernatural powers, or in particular, a human-made object that has power over others. Essentially, **Fetishism** is the attribution of inherent non-material value, or powers, to an object. Talismans and amulets are related. Fetishes are often used in spiritual or religious context.
