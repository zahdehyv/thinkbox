> In classical mechanics, **Maupertuis's principle** (named after Pierre Louis Maupertuis, 1698 â€“ 1759) states that the path followed by a physical system is the one of least length (with a suitable interpretation of path and length).  It is a special case of the more generally stated principle of least action.  Using the calculus of variations, it results in an integral equation formulation of the equations of motion for the system.
