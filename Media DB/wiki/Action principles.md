> **Action principles** lie at the heart of fundamental physics, from classical mechanics through quantum mechanics, particle physics, and general relativity. Action principles start with an energy function called a Lagrangian describing the physical system. The accumulated value of this energy function between two states of the system is called the action. Action principles apply the calculus of variation to the action. The action depends on the energy function, and the energy function depends on the position, motion, and interactions in the system: variation of the action allows the derivation of the equations of motion without vectors or forces.

> Several distinct action principles differ in the constraints on their initial and final conditions.
>
> The names of action principles have evolved over time and differ in details of the endpoints of the paths and the nature of the variation. Quantum action principles generalize and justify the older classical principles. Action principles are the basis for Feynman's version of quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory.
>
> The action principles have applications as broad as physics, including many problems in classical mechanics but especially in modern problems of quantum mechanics and general relativity. These applications built up over two centuries as the power of the method and its further mathematical development rose.
