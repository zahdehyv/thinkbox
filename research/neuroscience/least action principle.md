what's this???
the paper [[sennNeuronalLeastactionPrinciple2024|A neuronal least-action principle for real-time learning in cortical circuits]] mentioned it

> [!todo]
> research required

read more about it in [[Action principles]]

> [!example]
> ![[Maupertuis's principle]]

the thesis [[meulemansControlbasedTheoriesCredit2024|Control-based theories for credit assignment in neural networks and reinforcement learning]] discusses the least-control usage in [[Machine learning]]
