> [!ABSTRACT]
>The processes whereby our brains continue to learn about a changing world in a stable fashion throughout life are proposed to lead to conscious experiences. These processes include the learning of top-down expectations, the matching of these expectations against bottom-up data, the focusing of attention upon the expected clusters of information, and the development of resonant states between bottom-up and top-clown processes as they reach an attentive consensus between what is expected and what is there in the outside world. It is suggested that all conscious states in the brain are resonant states, and that these resonant states trigger learning of sensory and cognitive representations. T'he rnoclcls which sunnnari~e these concepts arc therefore called Adaptive Resonance 'J'heory, or ARJ', models. Psychophysical and neurobiological data in support of AHT are presented from early vision, visual object recognition, auditory streaming, variable-rate speech perception, somatosensory perception, and cognitive-emotional interactions, among others. It is noted that Altr nrccha.nisrns seem to be operative at all levels of the visual system, and it is proposed how these mechanisms are rca.li~ecl by known laminar circuits of visual cortex. It is predicted tha.L the sarne circuit realiz,a.tion of AHT rnccha.nisms will be found in the laminar circuits of all sensory and cognitive neocortex. Concepts and data are sumnmrized concerning how 0ome visual percepts rna.y be visibly, or rnodally, perceived, whereas amodal percepts rna.y be consciously recogni~ed even though they a.rc perceptually invisible. It is a.lw suggeBted tha.t. sensory a.nd cognitive processing in the What processing stream of tbc brain obey top-down rnatching and learning laws that are often complerncntary to those used for spatial and rnotor processing in the brain's Where processing strcarn. 'fhis enables our sensory and cognitive representations to rnainta.in their stability as we learn more about the world, while allowing spa.t.ial and rnotor representations to forget learned maps and gains that are no longer appropriate a.s our bodies develop a.nd grow from infanthood to adulthood. Procedural memories are proposed to be unconscious because the inhibitory matching process that support.B these spatial and motor processes cannot lead to rewna.nce.
