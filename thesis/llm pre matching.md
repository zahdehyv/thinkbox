the paper [[liRetroLLMEmpoweringLarge2024|RetroLLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Retrieve Fine-grained Evidence within Generation]] uses the idea of the model generating a cite and then matching it on the context, using something called the [[Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform]] and [[FM-index]]
it talks also about [[False Pruning]] as a potential issue with this aproach

for efficient search it also uses the [[Wavelet Tree]]

==I have still not clear when the search is performed==
i think it constraint the output of the model using the [[FM-index]] 

> [!warning] how clever

> search for the [[liRetroLLMEmpoweringLarge2024|RetroLLM]] paper arxiv latex
i also think the references in this paper are a good start point
