My style is loco, Yoko Ono, manic, vocal  
I'm not your uncle, I'm aunty-social  
Postal, danger to the world, I've gone global  
Schizophrenic menace, put myself in a chokehold  
Ho-ho, yeah, bro, tasty like a Rolo  
Spiritual being, yes, I'm holy like a polo  
You know, you could set this song as your ringtone  
Lord of the ring-ring, you could be Frodo Gimli

I'ma take this rhythm, man, and smoke it like a chimney  
I'm a punk rocker, sucker, no, I'm not an indie  
Kiddie with a Bindi  
Yes, I will be in the shed taking my meds  
I slice up beats like a knife through bread  
When I go bowling, I use decapitated heads  
I lose brains in the lanes, so they call me miss-a-lane-eous  
I'm the type of kid who makes cotton wool dangerous

I'm trying hard not to lose my mind, whoa-oi  
I see stars when I close my eyes, whoa-oi  
I try to keep this beast inside, whoa-oi  
But I'm close to the edge and I might lose my head, so I guess you better hide

My style is manic, close to the boil, volcanic  
I watch so much Scarface, I think I'm Hispanic  
Okay! Don't make me get loco on you, ese  
Putos! I bust a cap, watch me get messy  
Mentos and coke, I'm about to explode  
I'm so open-minded that my eyes can't close  
Doctor, doctor, give me some smiles  
A 20-pack of Valium, numb for a while

Flow like the Nile, evil crocodile  
I've got the local zoo saved on speed dial  
Funky, I spent a bit of time with the monkeys  
I gave one a Valium, now he's a junkie  
Humpty Dumpty, he fell down  
All the king's horses were stumped somehow  
Hmm, of course all the horses were stumped  
Horses don't even have opposable thumbs

I'm trying hard not to lose my mind, whoa-oi  
I see stars when I close my eyes, whoa-oi  
I try to keep this beast inside, whoa-oi  
But I'm close to the edge and I might lose my head, so I guess you better hide

My teeth start juttering, I'm stuttering, buttering words like Flora  
Edible, spreadable, style glow like Aurora  
Northern light ignite the night tonight  
Excite the mic, right like a viper bite  
It's just my venom, it's Ren and my lucky number; seven  
I don't follow fashion, so I'm wearing double denim  
Mel Gibson crazy, my mind's a lethal weapon  
Got kicked out the fruit store for grabbing a girl's melons

Said "Get 'em", with a baseball bat type force or a harpoon  
I'm knocking you for six when I hit with the beat, with a bang, with a boom  
I'ma fly right out of this room, I'ma take off to the moon  
I'ma rip when I spit when I bite my lip and I'm sick when I bust a move  
Like, yes sir! I'ma take this microphone and make some a cappella  
Music for your eardrums, it's vocal architecture  
Stack it up like bricks, yes, I'm stacking up that texture  
I bring the vibes right into the sector

I'm trying hard not to lose my mind, whoa-oi  
I see stars when I close my eyes, whoa-oh-oh-oi  
I try to keep this beast inside, whoa-oi  
But I'm close to the edge and I might lose my head, so I guess you better hide

La-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la  
La-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, ah-la-la  
La-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la  
La, la-la-la-la-la
